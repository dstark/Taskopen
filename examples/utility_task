# EXAMPLE: utility tasks
#
# DESCRIPTION
# Taskopen can be used to execute arbitrary commands that exist as annotations
# to taskwarrior tasks. A utility task is one that carries a "payload" of one
# or more commands, and is intended for a specific function.
# (This is an alternative approach to the 'templates' example.)
#
# SETUP
# Copy all bu the General section to your config file.
# Alternatively, you can test this configuration with a temporary data base,
# by calling
#   export TASKOPENRC=/path/to/examples/markdown
#   taskopen ...
# In order to operate on the temporary data base with taskwarrior, you may
# define an alias like:
#   alias tx="task rc.data.location=/tmp"
#
# USAGE
# Add a new task and annotate with labeled commands:
#   task add backup files due:eow
#   task 102 annotate -- backup_home_directory: ~/bin/mybackup_app -f home
#   task 102 annot -- backup_etc_directory: /usr/bin/unison -opts /etc
#   task 102 ann -- backup_var_directory: /usr/bin/rsync -opts /var
#
# Then, when you want to back up your files, run taskopen
#
# $ taskopen backup -x
#
# choose the desired actions(s) from the list and voila!
# (just don't use the made-up commands used as examples)
