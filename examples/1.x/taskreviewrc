#- taskreviewrc - taskopen-review configuration file with instructions
#
# Intended as basis for a daily/ weekly/ project task review process.
# Using UUID.review.txt files as review log files, and using their access/ modification times 
# to drive the review sequencing logic, as opposed to using review-specific date-stamps, UDAs, tags
# or other taskwarrior attributes. 
#
# Add an alias to taskrc:
# alias.review=taskopen -c ~/.taskreviewrc -n
#
# Add a cronjob which executes:
#
#    $ task (age.over:1wk AND annotation.not:Review) mod annotate Review
#    $ taskopen -c ~/.taskreviewrc -n -i '[ -e "$1" ] || touch "$1"'
#
# (Note that "-i" is used here as a variant of "-b -x" without user interaction.)
#
# Start a review, which can be restricted to a subset by using filters:
#
#    $ task review project:taskopen

# Reuse the NOTES feature
